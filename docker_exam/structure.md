# Remarks and Justification

Set up the testing environment using Docker and Docker Compose. Here are the remarks and justifications for these choices:

1. **Containerization**: Docker is used to containerize the API and test components. Containerization provides a consistent and isolated environment, making it easier to package and deploy the application across different systems.

2. **Docker Compose**: Docker Compose is utilized to define and manage the multi-container application environment. It allows us to specify the services, their dependencies, networking, and configuration in a declarative YAML file.

3. **Separate Images for Each Test**: Each test component (authentication test, permission test, sentiment test) is built as a separate Docker image. This approach allows for modularity and flexibility, as each test can be independently developed, scaled, and updated.

4. **Mounting Log Directory**: A log directory is created on the host machine, and it is mounted into each container using a volume in the `docker-compose.yml` file. This ensures that the log files generated by the tests are persisted on the host machine and can be accessed even after the containers are stopped.

5. **Environment Variables**: Environment variables are used to configure certain aspects of the containers, such as enabling logging (`LOG=1`). These environment variables can be easily modified in the `docker-compose.yml` file, providing flexibility and customization options.

6. **Dependency Management**: The `requirements.txt` file is used to manage the Python dependencies required by the test scripts. This allows for reproducibility and easy installation of dependencies within the Docker images.

7. **Network Configuration**: A network is created in the `docker-compose.yml` file, allowing the containers to communicate with each other using their service names. This enables the tests to connect to the API container for performing the necessary HTTP requests.

8. **Testing Scripts**: The testing scripts (`test_authentication.py`, `test_permission.py`, `test_sentiment.py`) are written in Python and utilize the `requests` library to make HTTP requests to the API endpoints. The scripts contain test cases and assertions to verify the expected behavior of the API.

9. **Logging**: Logging is implemented in the test scripts to capture the output and write it to the log file (`api_test.log`). The log file is stored in the mounted log directory, allowing easy access and inspection of the test results.
